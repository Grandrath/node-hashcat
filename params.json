{"name":"node hashcat","tagline":"","body":"hashcat\r\n============\r\n\r\nA commandline utility to concatenate, minify and cache-bust your Javascript references in HTML.\r\n\r\nIt works by parsing the HTML file for special markup.  It then concatenates, minifies, hashes and replaces references to those files.  It is ideal for use with a build tool as part of your CI pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Install\r\n\r\n    npm install -g hashcat\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\n\r\nPrepare your references by surrounding them with special comment blocks.\r\n\r\n    <!-- #cat app-min.js -->\r\n    <script src=\"1.js\" />\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"other-folder/3.js\"></script>\r\n    <!-- endcat -->\r\n\r\nPass the HTML file to hashcat\r\n\r\n    hashcat app/index.html\r\n    \r\nAfter processing, the above reference should be replaced with something like this:\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"d41d8cd9.app-min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n##How\r\n\r\nThe two Javascript files are concatenated and minified into a single file.\r\nA hash of the resulting file's contents is then taken and the first 8 characters are prepended to the file's name.\r\nFinally, the reference blocks in the HTML are replaced with this new file.\r\n\r\nThe concatenation and minification allow for multiple files during development but a smaller, simpler asset in production.\r\n\r\nThe hash rename provides cache busting by changing the file name on each deployment if the contents have changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n##About\r\n\r\nThis tool is similar to the [grunt-usemin](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-usemin) task.  Currently, it uses some of the processing code but only processes Javascript references.\r\n\r\nIn our case, using grunt as part of a CI pipeline meant having to run `npm install` hundreds of times a day which was not desirable.\r\nA standalone tool solves this specific problem by reducing the external dependencies and does not leave the build agent in a transient state.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
